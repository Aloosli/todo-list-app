## Functionality
Adding to-do items: Enter the item in the input field and click the "Add Todo" button.
Deleting to-do items: Click the trash icon next to the to-do item to delete it.
Filtering to-do items: Use the filter dropdown to show either all items, completed items, or uncompleted items.
Storing to-dos: The app uses local storage to save the to-do items, so your list will persist even if you close the browser.
